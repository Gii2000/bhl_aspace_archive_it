# ArchivesSpace plugin for importing Archive-It seeds and exporting metadata

General idea being:
1. Create a seed in Archive-It. Use Archive-It to test, scope, and schedule crawls.
2. Create an archival object for the seed in ArchivesSpace. Use ArchivesSpace to create descriptive metadata for the Archive-It seed.
3. (TO DO) Export ODS spreadsheet from ArchivesSpace and upload it to Archive-It.
